for the final one:
```
1.
a hard real time system is when deadlines need to be met at the risk of catastrophic systems failure. Example is the engine control unit in a car

2.
a camera includes a microcontroller. and a desktop computer. Embedded systems are systems where the primary purpose is not computing. It is embdedded in a system that performs a task by making use of real time software and hardware

3.
e

4.
overwriting existing settings. The programmer should be mindful of the current settings enabled and modify their new write to ensure all other settings remain intact

5.
bit banding allows for atomic changes of bits without the read-write cycle normally needed by writing a word to a defined location in memory. This allows for instant bit manipulation


6: c 1.66 revolutions

7.
a.
Timer A is set to generate an interrupt when it reaches 6000, and then terminate due to the one shot mode. After it has reached this value, the ISR called Timer0IntHandler will run

b.
6000/3 000 000 = 2 miliseconds

8. c
9. a
10. 65,535
11. 
a
it contains the program counter which points to the next instruction to be executed
b
it holds the accumulation of all the instructions performed on the value inside it

12.

15.
C will inherit the priority of A until C posts the semaphore.
so it will become C = A > B

16.
d

17.
