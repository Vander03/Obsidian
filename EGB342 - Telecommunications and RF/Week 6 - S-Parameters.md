> [!Definition]
> **Scattering Matrix [S]** - also known as S-parameters. Used because its difficult to measure impedance (Z) using V or I. Is based on incident transmitted and reflected (scattered) waves.

## 1 Scattering Matrix

The scattering matrix is used to describe the relationship between the incident (incoming) and reflected (outgoing) wave amplitudes at various ports in a multi-port network, detailing how waves are reflected and transmitted between different input and output ports.

## 2 Properties of S-Matrix
### 2.1 Reciprocal Networks
A network is reciprocal if it is passive and contains only isotropic materials:
i.e.
$$S_{mn} = S_{nm}$$

### 2.2 Lossless Networks
Total power entering $N$ ports = total power leaving $N$ ports:
