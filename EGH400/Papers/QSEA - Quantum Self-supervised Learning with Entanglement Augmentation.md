**Motivation**
- In few-shot learning with limited samples, performance of SSL becomes dependent on the diversity and quality of augmented data. Of which classical augmentation mechanisms such as cropping, colour distortion and geometric transformations fail to capture sufficient semantic variation, leading to overfitting and poor generalisation. 

**Proposal**
- Quantum Self-supervised learning with entanglement augmentation method (QSEA) that leverages quantum entanglement and fidelity to enable effective SSL
- Optimises enhanced dataset representations via a fidelity based loss which enables robust training under few-shot conditions
