TFF-aDCNN: A Pre-Trained Base Model for Intelligent Wideband Spectrum Sensing:

According to the literature on spectrum measurement [35],
[36], [37], [38], [39], we know that the spectrum usage patterns
of different cities are different, and even the same frequency band
has different activity patterns in different regions. Therefore, it
is difficult to have a general model that can learn the regularity
of spectrum usage everywhere.
