Thierry (Part 2)
- What is machine learning
- Classification and regression
	- Regression to determine a number or class
- Knowing the types of machine learning
- Linear regression
- Understanding the process of ML
	- Data for training and testing etc
- Supervised learning
- Regression
	- Regression will be specified
	- Loss functions and its role
	- Over fitting and under fitting
	- **dont have to worry about regularisation**
- There will be probabilities (conditional in particular)
	- Bayes rule
	- given a scenario with facts (prior probs etc)
	- always define variables
- Classification methods
	- wont have to do an SVM or random forest
	- Naive bayes classifier etc
- Should know classification evaluation stuff
- Questions about proper practice (ethics)
- f1 score etc need to know how to compute 
- Binary and multiple classification problems (wont be tons of classes but more than 2)
- Deep learning
	- more about understanding proper practice
	- how do you proceed and whats the roles of different functions
	- what are recommendations to ensure a good result and how do you know if you've got a good result
	- "Understand how to go through due process, not understand all the small bits"
- Examples he shows:
	- Week 7 ("good examples and types of exercises found in the exam)
	- "answers here are more detailed than what you need to give in the exam, but more is better"
- Coding is more about the process than coding
- Quizzes have relevant questions
- **will not ask questions about backpropgation**
