## Trust
Team members need to be able to trust each other and be vulnerable 

## Conflict
Conflict is needed to challenge and improve ideas. With trust, conflict just becomes the pursuit of truth.

## Commitment 
Teams that don't engage in discussion most often lack commitment to the decided idea. Everyone needs to weigh in on a decision.

## Accountability
Holding each other accountable is essential to maintain high quality work and work ethic

## Results
We need to focus on the collective results of the team

Google has released that theres 5 key dynamics that set successful teams apart from others:
- **Psychological Safety:** Can we take risk on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed
- **Dependability:** Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time
- **Structure and Clarity:** Are goals, roles and execution plans on our team clear?
- **Meaning of Work:** Are we working on something that is personally important to each of us?
- **Impact of work:** Do we fundamentally believe that the work we're doing matters

## Diversity in the workplace
Team diversity brings new experiences to the table to help improve how well products are received by accounting for the differing experiences the team members have endured.

Inherent diversity, however, is only half of the equation. Leaders also need acquired diversity to establish a culture in which all employees feel free to contribute ideas. Six behaviors, we have found, unlock innovation across the board: ensuring that everyone is heard; making it safe to propose novel ideas; giving team members decision-making authority; sharing credit for success; giving actionable feedback; and implementing feedback from the team. Leaders who give diverse voices equal airtime are nearly twice as likely as others to unleash value-driving insights, and employees in a “speak up” culture are 3.5 times as likely to contribute their full innovative potential.

All of the interviewees concluded that the diversity of the project team contributed positively to both task performance and process outcomes (i.e. overall team cohesiveness), but perhaps not in a way that is commonly discussed in academic literature. We found four key insights, each of which is discussed in detail below:

Cultural and/or personality diversity is in the eye of the beholder
Cultural diversity can positively contribute to people’s professional and personal enjoyment of the project, as well as a project’s outcome
Cultural diversity can indirectly encourage project members to rethink their usual working habits and expectations, behave with fewer assumptions about the “right” way to address an issue and promote linguistic clarity
The dominance of cultural diversity amongst team members reduces the bias to interact with people who have common characteristics and create a unique bond.
1. Cultural and/or personality diversity is in the eye of the beholder

The academic literature seems to suggest that country of origin will be the salient factor in a multicultural group and have a dominant influence on an individual’s mindsets and behaviours. More particularly it is assumed that in a culturally diverse group, cultural norms will create confusion or conflict, or alternatively, creative insights into markets and products. In contrast, the project members in the Case Study revealed a full spectrum of opinions as to whether individual differences were personality determined, culturally determined or both. For example:

(a) Personality determined “I do not think our cultural background was relevant to the way we interacted as a team. I rather think our personality derived from our experience was the key factor. For example, B and D are both Australians but showed very different approaches to work” (Japanese team member).“It's not about nationality but personality. It is about understanding what each person needs to work to their best. It's about knowing people, adapting and reading people” (Australian client).

(b) Culturally determined: “I think culture was very relevant to how we worked as a team. I think culture influenced our individual styles - which I felt were markedly different” (Australian team member). “I could really see cultural attitudes (maybe stereotypes?) in each person’s style” (Spanish team leader)

(c) Culture and personality combined: “I am inclined to say that workplace employee traits are more closely aligned to personality than cultural background. Namely, how one behaves (what they say, how they act) at work is more linked to their level of introversion vs. extroversion and how they handle conflict. That’s not to say someone’s level of introversion/extroversion and overall personality isn’t influenced by their cultural background. So everything really plays a role” (American team member).“I don’t think that one can distinguish between just those two dimensions…. (we were) selected into the organisation based on certain personality traits such as an “openness to new experiences, drive for achievement, conscientiousness and a keenness to develop and grow. Cultural background however, helps (us) shape (our) work and tell a certain story” (German team member).

These views question the direct relevance of cultural diversity on team performance.

2. Cultural diversity can positively contribute to people’s professional and personal enjoyment of the project, as well as a project’s outcome

The cultural diversity of the team provided an unexpected point of enjoyment in their working relationships, with members connecting with each other over the sharing of new cultural information. During the interviews, team members referred to their professional enjoyment of the project, observing that "the diversity of the group definitely enhanced the experience (for me)", “’I think the mix of people and the professional friendships we formed were a product of people being culturally-curious and wanting to get to know their colleagues” and that "I was constantly challenged to think outside of my normal mode of analysis". Speaking of their personal enjoyment of working in a diverse team, one respondent commented that "finding out about the cultural backgrounds of team members was an important part of building relationships with them", while another spoke of valuable self-development: "I truly feel as though I've grown as an individual through this project".

3. Cultural diversity can indirectly encourage project members to rethink their usual working habits and expectations, behave with fewer assumptions about the “right” way to address an issue and promote linguistic clarity

It appears that the presence of cultural diversity, and perhaps the expectation of culturally determined differences, caused team members to become more conscious of their own work habits and to consider options for different approaches or solutions.  For example, one team member observed two different people-management styles in co-workers (one style being a single-minded focus on getting required information from the business, the other style being a focus on building social relationships/friendships to socially co-opt the business into volunteering the required information) and concluded that both styles were more effective than their own 'softly-softly' approach to cajoling the required information from the business.

Another unexpected and positive benefit related to linguistic diversity with team members speaking Japanese, Spanish, English and German as their first languages (with all speaking English well). It might be assumed that in a time pressured environment, the need for speed of communication will be enhanced by commonality of a first language. The Case Study revealed that the quality of communication can in fact be enhanced by linguistic diversity. In particular, whilst accents and turns-of-phrase sometimes caused short-term barriers to communication, the language differences provided a strong catalyst for clearer communication for all team members. Team members observed that "taking more time to make sure that things were explained clearly" was a valuable lesson to deploy in any work context. One respondent, self-admittedly inclined to be more assertive in meetings, remarked that they had "learned to listen to my colleagues and to appreciate their contributions". Finally, the client observed sagely that some local personnel express frustration with having to repeat information to people who are non-English speaking nationals; however, that may be an issue of false attribution. She noted that when she is unclear about something "I just ask for more information. And that is what I would say to people who I work with every day, i.e. native-born English speakers".  

Finally, the linguistic diversity provided an unexpected point of connection between team members, as explained by one team member “although there were times when language or pronunciation differences presented themselves, the team ended up laughing over the subtle misunderstandings, and bonding even more in the long run as a result of them”.

4. The dominance of cultural diversity amongst team members can reduce the bias to interact with people who have common characteristics and create a unique bond

One recurring theme in the responses was the sense that "being from diverse backgrounds and countries of origin (meant that) we felt that being 'different' made us the same in many ways" and that "as everyone in the team was from a different country there was not an accepted cultural norm within the group". The 'levelling-effect' of this diversity seemed to harness the team together around a genuine belief that their sum could be better than their individual parts, with one team member commenting that the diversity "made me feel more confident about our likelihood of success, and that any challenge which might arise would be overcome". The diversity of the team also seemed to have a galvanising effect on the team, resulting in one person describing how "the fact that we all came from different countries…made us connect in a very special way. It felt like we became like a little 'family' and provided additional support to one another…..personally, I felt very close to my fellow team members and have established some great relationships".

Leadership Interview Questions and Answers
Sample Answer — “Tell Me About a Time You Had to Lead and Motivate People.”
Here’s an overview of how to use the STAR format specifically to answer a leadership interview question and present a leadership experience:

S/T (Situation/Task)
Briefly describe the project or situation. Give just enough history and/or background to provide context.

Example Situation/Task Bullet Points

When I was at ABC Company, we went through some company-wide layoffs.
The team of five that remained in the department had to absorb the duties of the two that left.
As a result, people were overworked and morale suffered.
At the same time, more mistakes were being made because attention was so scattered.
As the manager, it was my job to get performance back on track.
Why We Like These Bullet Points

With these bullets, the candidate quickly paints a picture of the challenge faced. She had to motivate a team of people who were stressed out, negative, and overworked. This scenario obviously required strong leadership skills.

Tip: Avoid the temptation to get bogged down in too much detail. You don’t need to fill the interviewer in on the reasons for the lay-offs, exactly how individual team members responded, or exactly what mistakes were being made.

A (Approach)
Talk about the key actions that you took. When telling a leadership story, make sure that you convey specifically how you stepped up as a leader. What actions did you take and why? How did your actions demonstrate leadership?

Example Approach Bullet Points

I scheduled a meeting of the full team to discuss strategies.
I communicated my appreciation for all of their hard work during a challenging time for the company.
I asked for their assistance in identifying ways for us all to be more efficient –including me!
I made it clear that this was a brainstorming meeting to come up with options — that no idea was stupid and that it was a safe environment for making suggestions.
We spent an hour capturing ideas on a whiteboard, then voted on the five with the most potential. I then assigned each person to do more research on how we might implement one of the ideas.
Why We Like These Bullet Points

She gives us a step-by-step breakdown of her leadership strategy. She empowered her people to help solve the problem, she opened herself up to constructive feedback, and she made everyone feel valued and heard.

Tip: Remember that managing a team doesn’t necessarily make you a great leader. It’s important to choose a story that demonstrates true leadership — stepping up to guide or motivate or take initiative, ideally in challenging circumstances.

R (Results)
A strong STAR interview story always includes a happy ending. Wrap up your example by describing the positive outcome(s) of your action. Quantifiable results are particularly impressive (boosted sales by 32%, saved the organization $19K), but anecdotal results also can work well (My client was delighted and sang my praises to my manager, my VP loved our creative approach and promoted me).

Example Results Bullet Points

First of all, the team responded very positively to this approach. They loved the idea of being empowered to help find a solution. Instead of complaining, they channeled their energy in a more productive way once they knew that they would be heard.
Right off the bat, we came up with two ideas that could be implemented quickly and save us a lot of time.
One idea was to eliminate a weekly report. This freed up 8 hours each week — including two hours of my time and three hours for my top account manager.
Another was to train Penny, our administrative assistant, to take on some of the tasks that were burdening our account managers.
We also decided to incorporate brainstorming and idea evaluation into our staff meetings each month.
We are now more efficient and morale is way up.
My boss even asked me to help him roll this process out to the other departments in our division.
Why We Like These Bullet Points

This is a great happy ending. The candidate covers a number of positive outcomes:

Increasing morale by empowering the team members
Improving efficiency and saving 8+ hours per week
Impressing the big boss so much that he wants other departments to follow the candidate’s approach
Tip: It’s nice to have some specific numbers (freeing up 8+ hours per week), but the anecdotal results are equally impressive in this example. The fact that the candidate’s boss “stole” the idea for other departments shows it was a real success.

More Tips for Handling Leadership Interview Questions
1. Choose a Strong Example
Select an example that really shows off your leadership skills. Don’t settle for a weak example (“I was the leader for my group project and everything went okay for the most part.”)
Customize the example if you can. Review the job description carefully and identify the type of leadership skills required for the role. Often, the desired leadership capabilities are spelled right out in the job description. One position may require managing a large team and another may be looking for someone who can take initiative.
Don’t try to boast with an answer like, “I consider myself a born leader and have always sought out leadership opportunities over the years.” It’s boring and it doesn’t answer the question.
This should go without saying, but avoid examples that could raise red flags. For example, don’t talk about leading a project that was an utter failure due to your mistakes.
2. Get Specific About What You Did
Be detailed. The best stories include enough detail to be believable and memorable. Show how you were a leader in this situation and how it represents your overall leadership experience and/or potential.
Be concise. Make an effort to keep the story relatively short. It can be tempting to go off on tangents, particularly if you haven’t prepared in advance. Using the STAR format will help you keep it focused.
Remember: Don’t try to script your story out word-for-word. The example above is far more scripted than you want or need. We took this approach to make it easy for readers to understand. However, for your own stories, you can just jot down the key bullet points for each section. The idea is to create a framework that ensures you cover the most important and impressive aspects of the experience.
