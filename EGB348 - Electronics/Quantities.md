**DC Values ($( I_{B0}, V_{BE}, \dots )$):**
These represent the constant, steady-state bias values of current and voltage. For example:
	•	$I_{B0}$ : The DC component of the base current.
	•	 $V_{BE}$ : The DC bias across the base-emitter junction.


**AC Values ($( i_b, v_{be}, \dots )$):**
These represent the small-signal or time-varying (AC) components, which fluctuate around the DC bias points due to an input signal.
	•	 i_b : The small-signal fluctuation in the base current.
	•	 v_{be} : The small-signal fluctuation in the base-emitter voltage.

**Instantaneous Total Values ($( i_B, v_{BE}, \dots )$):**
These are the sum of the DC and AC components at any moment. So, for instance:

$i_B = I_B + i_b$

This equation shows that the instantaneous current is the sum of the DC current  $I_B$  and the time-varying AC current  $i_b$. Similarly, the instantaneous voltage across the base-emitter junction is:

$v_{BE} = V_{BE} + v_{be}$

In essence, the instantaneous value reflects the total behavior (both steady-state and dynamic) at any given point in time.
