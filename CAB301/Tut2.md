Doing theoretical and big O in the first assessment 

1.
.a) ii
.b) i
.c) iv

2.
.a) basic operation x $\leftarrow$ x + 1
	let c be the time taken to run x $\leftarrow$ x + 1
	$f(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c$
	this is c added to itself for every number from 0 to n-1
	there are n - 1 - 0 + 1 (upper - lower + 1) numbers between 0 and n-1 so c is added to itself n times
	therefore efficiency is 
	$f(n) = nc \in O(n)$
.c) 
**probability**:
scenario where buying lottery tickets
one ticket is 10$ and winning is 110$ (+100$ return)
Prob of winning is 50%

efficiency function
$f(n) = b*nc+(1-b)*n^2c$
probability of the if statements falling through or being true, with the processes in them

d.) consecutive, just add them up

3. algo analysis
