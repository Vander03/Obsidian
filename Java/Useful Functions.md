## String 
`.valueOf()` - converts brackets to a printable string value
`System.out.println` - prints line to console

## Libraries 
`java.util` - collections, data structures, date and time, random number generation, hashmaps
`java.io` - work with files, streams readers and writers
`java.net` - communication over the network using sockets, URLs and other network related features
`java.lang` - low level classes and objects

## Methods
`public void Direction parse(String arg)` - parses info from a string (extracts a character or number)

## Variables
`this == object` - checks if the object passed to the method is the same as the local object by checking if they occupy the same space in memory. Avoids type specific checking (very cool)
