Cloud is **Elastic** **Computing** at **Scale**
**Utility** computing:
- IT infrastructure and services "piped in"
- Available on demand, pay for what you use
**Elastic** provisioning
- Scale services as we need them
- Automatically adjust scale with load

# Advantages of Cloud

Cloud providers can:
- Average out and absorb changes across multiple companies
- Solve a problem once and roll the solution out to everyone
- Rely on a steady stream of income to maintain and increase capacity

## 1 Outsourcing Risk
- Demand can fluctuate rapidly and this forces companies to pay for maximum capacity or lose traffic during peak. **Cloud can scale in and out on demand**
- Buggy or vulnerable application due to small team work across multiple areas. **Cloud provides pre build solutions to common problems**
- Risk of having stuff on the internet
	- **Cloud provider takes care of many or all aspects of security**, Services like DDoS protection are insurance against certain attacks

# Cloud Services

## 1 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Compute
	- Virtual Machines, bare-metal machines
- Storage
	- Block storage (HDD/SSD)
	- File Storage (NAS)
	- Object storage (objects similar to OOP)
- Networking
	- Routers, switches, load balancers
## 2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Automated workflows
	- Connect systems using abstract representations of data
- Speed
	- Use templates to deploy complex integrations as scale
- **AWS does not provide PaaSs**
## 3 Software as a Service (SaaS)
- A cloud based delivery mode for software
- Vendors use IaaS vendors to host software
- The customer does not handle infrastructure or data
- E.g. accounting software, security software, communications
- **AWS does not offer SaaSs**
## 4 Container as a Service (CaaS)
