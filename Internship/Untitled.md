For engineering internships in Brisbane, Australia—especially if you’re targeting a 30–60 day placement under a qualified engineer—your search should be focused, strategic, and local-industry aware. Here’s a structured breakdown of where and how to look:

⸻

1. University Resources (QUT-Specific)
	•	QUT Career Hub:
QUT has a dedicated platform for internships and graduate roles. Look under “Work Integrated Learning (WIL)” or “Engineering Placements”.

Email your lecturers and unit coordinators, especially those in your electrical or embedded systems classes. Many have industry partners and can refer you.
	•	QUT EAIT Student Society or QUT Robotics Club:
Members often have industry connections or have done placements themselves and can refer you or offer leads.

5. Cold Outreach (If You Want to Stand Out)

Find small-to-medium engineering companies in Brisbane via:

Tips for Approaching Them
	•	Be clear about QUT’s requirements (60 days, qualified engineer, etc.)
	•	Emphasize your embedded systems, I2C/UART, FreeRTOS, or software + hardware skills
	•	Offer a specific availability window and whether you require payment or not
