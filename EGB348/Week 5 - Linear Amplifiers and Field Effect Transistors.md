# 1 Linear Amplifier
A **linear amplifier** magnifies an input signal and produces an output signal whose magnitude is larger and directly proportional to the input signal. 

Note that in **linear circuits** and **systems**, the principle of superposition applies, which states that:
*The response of a linear circuit excited by multiple independent input signals is the sum of the responses of the circuit to each of the input signals alone.*

## 1 Analysing Linear Amplifiers
### 1.1 Linear Amplifiers Analysis
NOTE: the total response of the amplifier is the **sum of the two individual responses of DC and AC analysis**

#### 1.1.1 DC Analysis (Large signal analysis)
- Analysis of impact of DC establishes the Q-point of the transistors in the amplifier. 
- Due to linearity, the DC analysis can be performed with the AC source set to *zero. 

#### 1.1.2 AC Analysis (Time-varying analysis / small signal analysis)
- AC analysis can be done with DC source set to *zero
